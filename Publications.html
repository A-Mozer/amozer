										<h4>An introduction to illegal wildlife trade and its effects on biodiversity and society</h4>
										<p><b>Mozer, A.</b> & Prost, S.</p>

									<p class="justified-text">Illegal Wildlife Trade (IWT) is among the most lucrative illegal industries in the world. Its consequences go far beyond direct effects on the species in trade. In this review, we outline the basics of IWT and discuss its cascading consequences on environments, human lives and communities, national stability, and the economy. In addition, we outline structures used in IWT, from subsistence and local use to more complicated configurations, which can include multiple players. Furthermore, while a small fraction of poaching is opportunistic, most of the international IWT is run by organised crime groups. We outline how IWT can be associated with many different crimes like drug trafficking, corruption, or whitewashing. Additionally, many studies have observed a rapidly increasing trend of online trade with endangered and protected species. Moreover, this review gives a short overview of the situation in the European Union (EU) regarding laws and implementation of CITES and highlights that the EU acts as a major source, transit hub, and consumer in IWT. To address the highly dynamic and complicated problem of IWT, research, knowledge exchange, funding, and collaborations in all fields are necessary.</p>

										<h4>FOGS: A SNPSTR Marker Database to Combat Wildlife Trafficking and a Cell Culture Bank for <i>Ex-Situ</i> Conservation</h4>

									<p class="justified-text">Illegal wildlife trade is a growing problem internationally. Poaching of animals not only leads to the extinction of populations and species but also has serious consequences for ecosystems and economies. This study introduces a molecular marker system that authorities can use to detect and substantiate wildlife trafficking. SNPSTR markers combine short tandem repeats with single nucleotide polymorphisms within an amplicon to increase discriminatory power. Within the FOGS (Forensic Genetics for Species Protection) project, we have established SNPSTR marker sets for 74 vertebrate species. On average, each set consists of 19 SNPSTR markers with 82 SNPs per set. More than 1300 SNPSTR markers and over 300 STR markers were identified. Also, through its biobanking pipeline, the FOGS project enabled the cryopreservation of somatic cells from 91 vertebrate species as well as viable tissues for later cell initiation from a further 109 species, providing future strategies for <i>ex situ</i> conservation. In addition, many more fixed tissues and DNA samples of endangered species were biobanked. Therefore, FOGS was an interdisciplinary study, combining molecular wildlife forensics and conservation tools. The SNPSTR sets and cell culture information are accessible through the FOGS database (<a href="https://fogs-portal.de/data">https://fogs-portal.de/data</a>) that is open to scientists, researchers, breeders and authorities worldwide to protect wildlife from illegal trade.</p>

										<h4>Joint detection of microsatellites and flanking sequences – SNPSTR markers for <i>Athene noctua</i> to fight illegal wildlife trade</h4>
										<p><b>Mozer, A.</b>, Consul, A., Misof, B., Jäger, R., Olek, K., & Astrin, J.J.</p>

									<p class="justified-text">Trade of wild-caught animals is illegal for many taxa and in many countries. Common regulatory procedures involve documentation and marking techniques. However, these procedures are subject to fraud and thus should be complemented by routine genetic testing in order to authenticate the captive-bred origin of animals intended for trade. A suitable class of genetic markers are SNPSTRs that combine a short tandem repeat (STR) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within one amplicon. This combined marker type can be used for genetic identification and for parentage analyses and in addition, provides insight into haplotype history. As a proof of principle, this study establishes a set of 20 SNPSTR markers for <i>Athene noctua</i>, one of the most trafficked owls in CITES Appendix II. These markers can be coamplified in a single multiplex reaction. Based on population data, the percentage of observed and expected heterozygosities of the markers ranged from 0.400 to 1.000 and 0.545 to 0.850, respectively. A combined probability of identity of 5.3 * 10−23 was achieved with the whole set, and combined parentage exclusion probabilities reached over 99.99%, even if the genotype of one parent was missing. A direct comparison of an owl family and an unrelated owl demonstrated the applicability of the SNPSTR set in parentage testing. The established SNPSTR set thus proved to be highly useful for identifying individuals and analysing parentage to determine wild or captive origin. We propose to implement SNPSTR-based routine certification in wildlife trade as a way to reveal animal laundering and misdeclaration of wild-caught animals.</p>

										<h4>A high-quality reference genome for the Ural Owl (<i>Strix uralensis</i>) enables investigations of cell cultures as a genomic resource for endangered species</h4>
										<p>Chrysostomakis, I.*, <b>Mozer, A.*</b>, Bruno Di-Nizo, C., Fischer, D., Sargheini, N., von der Mark, L., Huettel, B., Astrin, J.J., Töpfer, T., & Böhne, A.   <i>*equal contribution</i></p>

									<p class="justified-text">We generated a reference genome for the Ural Owl (<i>Strix uralensis</i>) based on high-fidelity (HiFi) long reads and chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) data. The primary assembly had a size of 1.38 gigabase pairs (Gb), while the alternative assembly (i.e., the second haplotype) had a size of 1.3 Gb. The corresponding N50 was 90.1 Mb for the primary assembly and 17.0 Mb for the alternate assembly. The primary assembly achieved a compleasm BUSCO completeness of 99.94%, indicative of a high-quality genome. In addition, cell culture of progressive passages was evaluated as a tool for genetic resources. To this aim, a cell culture of the same Ural Owl individual was established from skin tissue. At passages 5 and 10, cells were harvested and investigated for possible nucleotide variants by analysing the karyotype and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to investigate the effect of cell culture on mutation. Karyotyping confirmed the number of chromosomes and no large variants were observed, while SNP analysis revealed a minor presence of short variants over cell passages. The established reference genome is a valuable resource for ongoing conservation efforts but also generally for avian genomics research. Cell culture, on the other hand, requires more research to determine if progressive passages can be safely used in genomic research.</p>

										<h4>Determination of sinapine in rapeseed pomace extract: Its antioxidant and acetylcholinesterase inhibition properties</h4>
										<p>Yates, K., Pohl, F., Busch, M., <b>Mozer, A.</b>, Watters, L., Shiryaev, A., & Kong Thoo Lin, P.</p>
										<p><i>Food Chemsitry 276</i>, 768-775. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.10.045">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.10.045</a></p>

									<p class="justified-text">Sinapine is the main secondary metabolite present in rapeseed pomace (RSP) with its concentration being dependent on rapeseed processing, growing conditions, extraction parameters and the country of origin. Here we report, the concentration of sinapine from an extract of defatted RSP harvested in the North East of Scotland. Using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, the most abundant phenolic compound in the RSP extract was, as expected, sinapine (109.1 mg/g RSP extract). Additionally, sinapic, caffeic, ferulic and syringic acids were identified (0.159–3.91 mg/g RSP extract). Sinapine together with the phenolics at the concentration present in the RSP extract, exhibited ≥50% activity relative to the extract in antioxidant assays. Furthermore, sinapine provided plasmid DNA (pBR322) protection, from 2,2′-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride and inhibited acetylcholinesterase activity by 85%. Molecular docking was utilised to explain the inhibitory activity. RSP can be an excellent source of bioactive compounds for pharmaceuticals, food additive and nutraceutical applications.</p>
